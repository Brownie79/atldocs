**Using Alpha Trading Labs**
==============================

Welcome to Alpha Trading Labs. Use this documentation as your starting point for creating a successful trading model.

If you are new to Alpha Trading Labs and do not know where to start try going through :ref:`gs`, which will help 
you understand how the application works and how to set up a new model. 

Once you feel comfortable with the application, how it works, and what it does, you can start 
creating your own valuation functions to be passed into the trading model. The application uses a DSL made 
specifically for writing valuation functions which you can use, look at the DSL documentation to see what you
can use, and what it does.

To help you with your valuation function you also have available marketlib, a library of functions which
include both a series of ready made valuation functions you can use to start off with, and some helper 
functions to help you write your own.
